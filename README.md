🛡 Best Practices Learned
Length is critical – Aim for 12–16+ characters.

Mix all character types – Uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid dictionary words – Prevents easy dictionary attacks.

Use randomness – Avoid predictable patterns like Password123!.

Unique per account – Prevents credential stuffing attacks.

Use a password manager – To store and generate strong passwords.

Consider passphrases – Long but memorable (e.g., H0rse!BlueSky^Rain@77).

🔍 Common Password Attacks
Attack Type	Description	Prevention
Brute Force	Tries every possible combination	Use long, complex passwords
Dictionary	Uses lists of common words	Avoid real words and simple phrases
Phishing	Tricks user into revealing password	Be cautious with links/emails
Credential Stuffing	Reuses stolen passwords	Use unique passwords per site
📌 Complexity vs. Security
Short & simple passwords → cracked in seconds.

Moderate length + mixed characters → takes hours to months.

Long, random, mixed passwords → centuries to crack with current technology.

✅ Conclusion:
The strongest tested password was:

My_Anonymous_secur!ty$6349
Scoring 100%, it demonstrates that length + complexity + randomness are the key factors for a secure password.
